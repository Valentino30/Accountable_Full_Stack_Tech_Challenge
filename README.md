# Football Events Manager - Backend

The **Football Events Manager** backend provides APIs for managing football match events and ticket reservations.  
It handles event listings, user reservations (with limits per user/event), and integrates with MongoDB for persistence.

This service is built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
